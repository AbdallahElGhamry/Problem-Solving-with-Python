'''
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
		distan‚Å°ce = speed * time
For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours,
the distance traveled is 120 miles. Write a program that asks the
user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and the number
of hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the
distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period.
Here is an example of the desired output:
'''

speed = float(input('What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? '))
time = int(input('How many hours has it traveled? '))

for i in range(1, time+1, 1):
    distance = speed * i
    print(i, '\t', distance)
